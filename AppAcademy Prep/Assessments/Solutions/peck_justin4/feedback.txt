Your style needs work. Look at code 
from gitHub and on the internet if 
you need a reference. There's a wealth 
of information at your disposal, just 
search for it.

For arraySumN, please watch the solution 
video. You should make a function that
returns the sum of an array.

then you can type this:

for (var i in outerArray){
    var inner = outerArray[i];

    if (arrSum(inner) == n){
        someArray.push(inner);
    }
}
